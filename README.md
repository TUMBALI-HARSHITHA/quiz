# 🎮 Quiz & Drawing Game

## Inspiration ✨
We were inspired by the idea of mixing **learning with creativity**.  
Instead of building just a quiz app or just a drawing pad, we thought:  
“Why not combine both — test knowledge and spark imagination at the same time?”

## What it does 🧩
- Users can take **quizzes** in three categories:  
  🐾 Animals | ➕ Math | 🔬 Science  
- A **Drawing Game** mode lets users draw on a canvas to express creativity.  
- Questions appear **randomly each time** for a new challenge.  
- Results are shown at the end to track performance.  

## How we built it 🛠️
- **HTML** → Structured sections for Start, Quiz, Drawing, and Results.  
- **CSS** → Designed a fun, colorful, yet clean interface.  
- **JavaScript** →  
  - Quiz logic (random question generator, multiple categories).  
  - Drawing game using `<canvas>`.  
  - Section switching using `hidden` attributes.  

## Challenges we ran into 🚧
- Randomizing quiz questions without repetition.  
- Managing **multiple quiz categories** inside one script.  
- Making the drawing area feel like a **game** instead of just a blank pad.  
- Designing everything with **no frameworks**, just pure HTML, CSS, and JS.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
- Built a working project completely with **vanilla web technologies**.  
- Combined **education + creativity** into one platform.  
- Clean UI that makes it easy and fun for users to switch between modes.  

## What we learned 📚
- Deeper knowledge of JavaScript DOM manipulation.  
- How to handle the `<canvas>` API for drawing.  
- How to structure a multi-mode project (quiz + drawing) cleanly.  
- Importance of user experience in interactive apps.  

## What's next for Quiz & Drawing Game 🚀
- Add a **scoreboard/leaderboard** for players.  
- Introduce **timer-based challenges** ⏱️.  
- Add more question categories (History, Geography, etc.).  
- Enhance the drawing game with **color picker & shapes**.  
- Mobile-friendly responsive design.
